# Welcome to the course app!

Start this application by running npm start and go to localhost:3000.

Improvements/remarks regarding this application:

- This app works the best with at least 600px screen width
- Unfortunately I did not have time to complete showing the currencies or getting the more detailed course objects (with the currencies and start dates) from the API, but the rest is there
- Some other possible improvements could be making the app more responsive to different screen widths and adding a shopping cart or an overview of the courses the user has favoritized
